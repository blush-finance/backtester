# Backtester

## Introduction

This repo demonstrates how to create an investment strategy agnostic backtester.

In the Jupyter Notebook you can see two examples: a classical quant strategy and a machine learning strategy, both using the backtester.

## Next steps

- Move the backtester to a server
- Allow a user to upload an investment strategy as a file
